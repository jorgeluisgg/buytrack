[TASK]
Type: data_extraction
Goal: Analyze user-provided text or OCR output and convert it into a structured record that follows the predefined table schema.

Instructions:
1. Review the following input carefully.
2. Identify and extract the relevant data for each field in the expense record.
3. When a field is missing, apply the inference rules from the system prompt.
4. Never assume amounts or dates that are not explicitly present or inferable from clear context.
5. Output both:
   a) A JSON object containing the structured data.
   b) A natural-language confirmation message for the user.

JSON output format:
{
  "Owner": "",
  "Date": "",
  "Category": "",
  "Subcategory": "",
  "Amount spent": "",
  "Payment method": "",
  "Description": ""
}

Confirmation message example:
"Is this data correct for record?
Owner: Jorge Luis
Date: 01/11/25
Category: personal
Subcategory: renta
Amount spent: $10000
Payment method: efectivo"

If the user adds extra information such as “apartment 201”, ask:
"Would you like to add a description column and include 'apartment 201' as the content, or add it to an existing field?"

Always confirm before recording any data.

User or OCR text input:
{{input_text}}
